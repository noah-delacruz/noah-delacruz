## About Me üìù

My name is Noah dela Cruz and I'm a computer science graduate from San Jose, California. I've always had a passion for video games and technology ever since I was young, and this love ultimately inspired me to pursue a career in CS.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from UC Davis, where I gained a solid foundation in the field. I'm proficient in several programming languages, including C++, Python, and JavaScript. I enjoy applying these skills to solve complex problems and develop innovative solutions that improve people's lives.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the latest advancements in technology, reading up on the latest news in the gaming industry, and trying out new programming languages and tools. I'm always eager to learn and grow in the field of CS and am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.
